# Rate Limiting Engine

Production-grade, atomic, observable rate limiting for Python backends.

- ✅ **Token Bucket** + **Sliding Window** (Redis Lua — concurrency-safe)
- ✅ **OpenTelemetry tracing** — see why a request was denied
- ✅ **Prometheus metrics** — monitor abuse in real time
- ✅ **Stress-tested** — 250 reqs @ 3/sec → 238 allowed (exact math)

Built to survive Black Friday.  
No tutorials. No fluff. Just systems that hold.
